# SIAA Labs

<p align="justify">
SIAA Labs works on multiple projects involving scalable system architecture-aware 
optimizations for irregular applications and algorithms. The main research focus
involves providing scalable data movement optimizations for different irregular 
expressions with Sparse Matrix and Tensor kernels. We experiment on optimizations 
through different data structure layouts, and language and compiler expressions.

## Projects

### Sparse Datasets

<p align="justify">
The <a href="https://github.com/SIAALabs/sparse-dataset">sparse-dataset</a> 
github repository contains multiple shell scripts to retrive sparse matrix 
datasets from various locations. The retrieved sparse matrix datasets are 
represented in matrix-market format. We can use these datasets to perform 
analysis of our optimized sparse kernels.
