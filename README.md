# SIAA Labs

SIAA labs works on multiple scalable architecture specific optimizations for
irregular applications and algorithms. The main research focus of this group 
involves providing architecture specific scalable data movement optimizations 
through various abstractions in providing support for different expressions
involving data locality. We experiment on optimizations through different data 
structure layouts, and language and compiler expressions.

This is a github page describing the various associated projects providing its 
overview along with a brief description. Detailed descriptions on the projects
are available as part of the project specific github pages.
